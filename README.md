# Known Issues

- Rapidly pressing arrow keys will cause the snake to go back on itself

# Societal Impact

While this project is a simple implementation of Snake, all software carries some unconscious bias. However, much of it is avoided in this project. No user data or information is ever collected, stored, or transmitted to any source, which means that there cannot be any misuse of private information.

The game itself is accessible to vision-impaired users. It uses contrasting colors for ease of use and uses simple controls. Inputs can later be adapted for use with a joystick or other controls as well.

Overall, the project has little societal impact, however, it is a good starting place to practice transparency and inclusion.
